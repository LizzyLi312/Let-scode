Bellman-Ford vs. SPFA vs. Dijkstra – Understanding the Differences

These three algorithms (Bellman-Ford, SPFA, and Dijkstra) are used to find the shortest path in a graph, but they have different use cases, approaches, and efficiencies.

Use Dijkstra → If all weights are non-negative and performance matters. (ProprityQueue)

Use SPFA → If there are negative weights but no negative cycles, and you want a faster alternative to Bellman-Ford. (Queue)

Use Bellman-Ford → If you need to detect negative cycles in addition to finding shortest paths. (check cycle)
